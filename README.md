Notes
=====

A collection of code-related notes that I like to share with people.

They are in .js files because I like to type my notes in Sublime Text. I'm weird.  
You can do what I do and read them in a text editor, or you can copy the text into 
another program and format as you will.  

If you find any issues, feel free to fork and do a pull request!!

Thanks!
